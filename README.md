# 🔒 BAAD Tool - Comprehensive Data Protection  

## 📌 Overview  
**BAAD Security Tool** is a powerful Linux-based security tool designed for:  
✅ **Real-time Log Monitoring** using the `watchdog` library.  
✅ **Automatic Detection of Suspicious Activities** based on predefined keywords.  
✅ **Telegram Alerts** for instant notification of security threats.  
✅ **User-Friendly GUI** built with `Tkinter`.  

This tool is built **exclusively for Linux** and is ideal for system administrators and security professionals looking for an easy-to-use, automated security monitoring solution.

```

---

## ▶️ Usage  

### **Start the Main Tool**

```
or (if you granted execution permissions):

## ⚙️ How Log Monitoring Works  
- The tool monitors **`/var/log/syslog`** in real-time for security-related messages.  
- If suspicious keywords are detected (`error`, `failed`, `unauthorized`), an **alert is sent to Telegram**.  
- Users can **manually send alerts** via the GUI.  

---

## 📊 Example Output  
When running the tool, you will see logs like:  
```bash
[INFO] Monitoring started...
[ALERT] Suspicious activity detected in /var/log/syslog
[INFO] Sending Telegram alert...
[INFO] Monitoring stopped.
```
